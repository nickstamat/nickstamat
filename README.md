### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer, wearing the SRE hat. I implement DevOps best practices. I automate all the things and glue stuff together, with GitOps and Kubernetes.

I believe in fostering an engineering culture rooted in honesty, empathy, and effective communication.

- ⚙️ Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Terraform/OpenTofu, Argo CD, Go, Python, Ruby (kinda rusty nowadays)
